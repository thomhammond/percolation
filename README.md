# Percolation

An implementation of the Percolation datatype as specified by [this](URL "https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation/specification.php") Princeton Algorithms course project 

This implementation leverages the recommended [WeightedQuickUnionUF](URL "https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/javadoc/edu/princeton/cs/algs4/WeightedQuickUnionUF.html") class and utilizes a byte array approach to eliminate 'backwash'

Currently, PercolationStats is producing inconsistent results compared to the benchmarks provided by Princeton and I will address this in a future commit
